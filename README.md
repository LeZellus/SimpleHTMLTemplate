# Simple HTML Template

## Description

This project is a basic template for a website. It employs HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple yet extendable skeleton for web development. The project's architecture is designed to be intuitive and easy to customize.

## Project Structure

Here's the layout of the project:

- `index.html`: The main page of the site.
- `css/`: Folder containing the CSS files.
    - `reset.css`: Resets default browser styles for consistency across browsers.
    - `style.css`: Contains custom styles for the site.
- `js/`: Folder containing the JavaScript scripts.
    - `app.js`: The main JavaScript file for the site's functionality.
- `images/`: Folder containing the Images files.

## Using Reset CSS
